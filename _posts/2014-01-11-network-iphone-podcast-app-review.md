I read a humorous tweet/blogpost about how building a podcast app is the new building a Twitter app. It then linked to [Network](http://networkapp.net), a new podcast app for iPhone. The app was released less than a month ago, in December 2013. The screenshots at the App Store showed its modern design, and it was listed at an incredibly lightweight 1.1 MB. What, how is that even...?!

I love podcasts and podcast apps, so I went and bought it.

> Designed exclusively for iOS 7, Network is part of the next generation of iOS applications. Leveraging the best of what iOS 7 has to offer, while keeping the user interface clean, minimal and beautiful. Network strips the podcast app back to it's core components, eschewing complications in order to provide a very simple and efficient user experience.

The developer hit the mark on all these points. The app looks super clean, and is very pleasing to look at. The podcast main screen is exactly what I want; a large scroll list of cover art, each decorated with the number of new/unlistened podcasts downloaded. When no episodes are waiting for that podcast, the picture is dimmed heavily, and the picture fades away from prominence.

It's true that there are absolutely ZERO configuration options, and I wish it would have some config options available.

I'm happy to have found this app, and am looking forward to using it for an extended time.

###Things I Do When Listening To Podcasts###

The app looks great, but a podcasting app has got to make listening easy and convenient for me.

* I want the newest/freshest content right now
* refresh/reload my feed once a day; sometimes in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon. No matter the time, I want to check on demand.
* when playing, skip forward in increments of 30 sec or 2 mins.
* search for a new podcast by name

###Things Network Gets Right###

* the play screen has a large elements for the important functions: the pause/play button, a large scrubber button, and easy-to-hit reverse and forward buttons.
* the overall look and feel is very iOS 7. It's refreshing, and uses the best of iOS 7. Circles, thin fonts and no lines separating sections of the app. The app also sparingly uses faux button/textlabels prevalent in iOS 7.
* the play screen is clean and uncluttered. The podcast show description/notes are on a separate page, just a tap or swipe away.
* the search and subscribe process was fantastic. The search found all podcasts I gave it by name, and even brought all podcasts up when searching by publisher - i.e. TWiT and 5by5. The large add/search button on the main screen is a bonus.
* when you tap into search/add a new podcast, focus is given to the textbox and the keyboard appears immediately.
* giving you the choice to configure 3 items - skip interval for reverse and forward, and [playback speed](http://i.imgur.com/7lUnoGPm.jpg). In the 'simple' vein, the app remembers this setting globally between podcasts.
* easily remove a podcast from the menu: you tap and hold the cover art.


###Things I Wish Network Did (Better)###

I totally understand that this app was designed to be minimal. I'm not sure if the developer meant minimal features, or present a minimal design. In either case, I felt wanting a few things.

* support for remote fast-forward from headphones (when the phone is both locked and unlocked). Headphone buttons have the double-tap and hold to fast-foward the podcast at 2x speed.
* remove the "Podcast Completed" robot voice message at the end of an episode. It surprised me in a mildly annoying way and I don't like it. It seems like one of those features that are cool to implement, but it doesn't fit with the modern theme of this app.
* it's too easy to delete/mark a podcast as 'listened to' when in the [episode list](http://i.imgur.com/t5Y4UUgl.jpg). I've swiped an episode a handful of times by accident and have been forced to redownload it. By the time it's redownloaded, I've forgotten the place I was at.
* give me visual cues showing me my navigation options. This app's navigation is 50/50 swiping and buttons, and it takes some learning to know when to swipe to do that thing you want. 
* [when searching, sometimes you're presented with double/identical results](http://i.imgur.com/pEawO5nl.jpg), but no explanation as to what the difference between the two are. Likely this isn't the app's fault but rather the podcast feed itself being a duplicate.
* search results - show me whether the feed is for video or audio. e.g. any TWiT show has audio and video feeds. You need to carefully inspect the cover art to determine which is which.
* show cover art on the lock screen.
* allow me to force a refresh/check for new episodes on all podcasts on demand. You can manually [pull down to refresh a podcast feed](http://i.imgur.com/iZGdXttl.jpg), but to repeat that for your whole list would be tedious, it seems.
* tell me when you'll be autochecking my podcast feeds for new episodes.
* stop the bouncy effects - mostly noticeable for me between the play screen and the podcasts menu. Admittedly, it's one bounce, but it feels unnecessary.
* begin scrubbing forward or back. If you deviate your scrubbing from the horizontal line, it won't scrub, but will navigate to the notes page.
* larger cover art on the main menu. The whitespace (or is it greyspace?) on the side seems wasted. Perhaps this is a function of how cover art is distributed by the feeds. 
* when searching, let me browse through the episodes. Sometimes I want a podcast episode without subscribing.
* support variable speed scrubbing on the play screen

Network has definitely started off right! I'm going to give it a go for a few weeks and see how it does.
