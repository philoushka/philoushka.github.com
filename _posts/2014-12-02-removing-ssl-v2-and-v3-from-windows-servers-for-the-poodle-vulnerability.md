I was alerted that one of my servers was vulnerable to the recent POODLE vulnerability. (Padding Oracle On Downloaded Legacy Encryption)

Check if your Windows server is allowing the SSL v3 protocol at [PoodleScan](https://www.poodlescan.com)

Even worse, a default installation of Windows Server 2008 allows for SSL v2 in its negotiation list. [Ouch - bad problems with v2.](http://www.rapid7.com/db/vulnerabilities/sslv2-and-up-enabled). There are no built-in GUIs in Windows or IIS to modify which protocols are offered to connecting clients. [Windows 2012 R2 servers allow SSL v2 and v3 by default](http://i.imgur.com/DWJhxUx.jpg).

If you're running a web server for browsers, you can safely disable SSL v3 as the [browsers will support TLS 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Web_browsers). IE 6 isn't a browser.

If you're running web services like WCF, Web API, or SOAP, you should *test* this with your connected customers/systems in a test system beforehand.

Is this [SSL v3 vulnerability overhyped](https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-478.txt)? Perhaps. The SSL v2 issues definitely aren't. The point of this post is to provide the code to disable those protocols. The source 

###Disabling SSL v3###

Run either of these scripts, and then you **MUST RESTART Windows**.

**Use PowerShell**

**Use Command Prompt**
