[Scott Hanselman tweeted and called this "The Markdown Editor for Windows"](https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/309193260402888705). Solid endorsement. I was anticipating using Notepad++, as surely it has a syntax-highlighting plugin, but this application simply does all you need when editing Markdown in Windows.

I downloaded [MarkdownPad 2](http://markdownpad.com), and loved it. Smooth and simple.

I love that the product allows you to use your own CSS in the live preview, and it's got built-in image upload to Imgur that works like a champ; I'm so impressed with this feature.

The Pro upgrade is $15 USD. I went and bought the Pro after considering that this is a product built by a single developer, and I'll be getting a lot of use out of it.

##Feature Suggestions##

Feature clutter kind of sucks. Here's my crazy list of features that probably shouldn't be implemented, but I'll throw out there regardless. :)  

* **Saved Snippets**
I'd like to be able to insert a custom snippet of text. I regularly will start a document with an HTML comment at the top, or I want an empty JSON object snippet, or even a table. A toolbar button with a small dropdown allowing me to choose would be great.

* **Easy Tables**
Rolling your own is kind of a pain. A toolbar icon to quickly insert a pre-formatted 2x3 table would be handy.

* **Find and Replace All**
Implement a Find and Replace dialog (same as you find in Notepad++ and/or Visual Studio). Optionally find all matching tokens, and replace them with another. Bonus for doing this operation in all open documents.

* **Imgur Accounts**
I'd like image uploads to be under my own Imgur Pro account. This would ensure that the images won't be garbage-collected by Imgur after their 6 month period of inactivity. I can manage files under my account, etc.

* **Markdown Syntax Help**
I was expecting a link to a [Markdown syntax cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/howar31/5963000) or something in the Help menu. 

* **HTML element convert to Markdown syntax**
My use-case was that I had a bunch of HTML files that I was converting to Markdown. I had `<a href="">` and `<img>` in a whole bunch of files.
What would be nice is the option to right-click on the HTML tag, and have the program convert that to the Markdown equivalent.

* **Word Highlighting**
Double click a word, and all instances of that word in the current document are highlighted.

* **Dictionary Tweaks**
By default, add common web dev or software terms. I added the word CSS, and went to add JSON. Also, I couldn't find my custom dictionary entries anywhere in the options menu.

* **Local directory browser**
I'd sometimes like to be able to have a view into a local directory. Show me a list of files in a directory, allow me to click on any given .md file, and it would load into the editor.

* **Ribbon instead of a toolbar?**
I love the Office ribbon; would be nice to see similar in MarkdownPad. Obviously the effort would be large.
