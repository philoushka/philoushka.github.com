Stack Overflow does a great job of showing its users relevant jobs from its Stack Overflow Careers site. This one had the right skill/technology tags for me.

This [job advertisement](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/88613/chuck-norris-developer-ayuda-media-systems) has some problems, though.

### Juvenile Blowhard Job Title

**Chuck Norris**

This [meme started up in late 2005](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/chuck-norris). The application of it to a developer role in this advert is synonymous to that of ninja, guru, rock star, etc.

Here's [what developers think when you say "Rock Star"](http://blog.hirelite.com/what-developers-think-when-you-say-rock-star), "ninja", "guru", and other hyperbole.

> "rock star" communicates that you're not sure what you want. Or rather, you do know what you want, and what you want is a miracle worker. "Rock star" signals that you haven't thought enough about the role this developer will fill, leaving developers with a feeling that they'll be receiving ill-defined requirements, not enough time, or not enough resources to do their job (in addition to being overworked and underpaid).

To me, it shows that the employer has a sense of humour, but distracts from a level of seriousness a candidate wants to see. I'm going to leave my current job for this.

The problem is that **I don't want to be a know-it-all**. I want to continuously learn and help level up people around me. I want to be able to admit that I don't know technology xyz and for that to be OK.

So did the H.R. department sign off on this, or was this filed by the dev team manager? 

**Strike 1**: the job title doesn't jibe with my values.

### Dude-Bro Culture Poster

<a href="http://i.imgur.com/ap0JETT.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ap0JETTl.png"/></a>

The company's poster's message conveys or reinforces some poor attributes:

- male swagger (sunglasses, half shaven, popped collar)
- female fawning (giving it a slightly sexist tone)
- don't be nerdy (eww, yuck, what a loser, right!?)
- cash money (USD too)

What if I don't fit the attributes shown in the poster?

I'm trying to find an excuse for this poster. It doesn't come across self-deprecating or in jest. It leads me to believe that *they want to hire dude-bro self-aggrandizing smug know-it-alls*.

**Strike 2**: diverse candidates (females, non-white dude bros) are instantly turned off. This advert has failed in recruiting diverse people with new viewpoints and experiences, and has helped in reinforcing more of the same old Caucasian male. A company should *want* more diversity. 

Take a listen to the Stack Overflow Podcast episode *Diverse Hiring* and their realization about the subtle anti-diverse hiring messages they realized they were putting out.

Scrub to the 31:00 mark.

### Poor Description of Company Culture ###

At the top of the [company description](http://www.ayudasystems.com/Jobs):

> fast-paced, high-octane, exciting company set up with a West Coast philosophy. Think Google, Facebook, or Microsoft. 

> free beverages, our snack-filled candy wall, as well as our break room where you can show off your Foosball skills. Our uber-cool offices are located in the heart of Old Montreal

They blew it in the first 2 paragraphs. This is where the company is supposed to distill the most important information. Candidates know that you need to pay attention to the message you send out to potential employers. This employer hasn't taken the same approach here.

Those **are not valuable differentiators**. For me, I don't care about free snacks, foosball, break rooms. 

I care about:

- productivity and few interruptions
- remote working options
- company stability
- solid team members
- how many steps and time it takes to deploy to production
- how you hate waterfall as much as I do

**Strike 3**: we don't share the same values.

### My Takeaway

I get the feeling that the company's hiring message is loud and obnoxious because they are desperate. Their dude-bro culture appearance limits the candidates they can attract, so they double down on that attribute of their company. 

I wonder why the message is loud and blustery. Does their job advert show that the role has *a lot*, or rather *little* career and company culture value to offer to candidates?

I'm not saying the company's culture is dude-bro; only that it appears so, based on the messaging they use.

### How To Fix This Mess

- Publish a video of your dev team. Include short interview snippets with devs, shots of a code review, action shots of devs deploying to production, your quiet office space, your standup meetings, etc.
- Show me your company's diversity and/or why you value diversity.
- Learn what devs want. Market those things to devs in your job adverts.
