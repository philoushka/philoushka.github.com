There's a bot that will read your tweets, aggregate the word by frequency, and create a word cloud.

<a href="https://twitter.com/wordnuvola"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EmNSonEs.png" style="float:right" /></a>

Tweet something/anything [@wordnuvola](https://twitter.com/wordnuvola) and include the hashtag #wordcloud



The response came an hour later, and it was enjoyable to read.

The [source for the bot is on GitHub](https://github.com/defacto133/twitter-wordcloud-bot), and it's written in Python. It's a great read regardless of never having written Python.

I'm surprised the noisewords/[stopwords list](https://github.com/defacto133/twitter-wordcloud-bot/blob/97616e0f65b49fb0d15e0fab5a75bb54219290fc/assets/stopwords-en.txt) has 712 English words, and none are swear/offensive.
